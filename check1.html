            Udemy is an online training website for
             adults and students. He has been online since May 2010. In
             January 2020, the site has more than 50 million students and 57
             000 courses in 65 languages.
             When it was launched, the site offered classic courses as well as more eccentric courses such as seduction courses or courses to make money at poker2. In 2015, the company was criticized for its passivity in the face of the presence of courses stolen and used by Udemy3 trainers. In 2017, the company tackled the French market4.

            Udemy courses are entirely on-demand. You can begin the course
            whenever you like, and there are no deadlines to complete it. Udemy
            courses can be accessed from several different devices and
            platforms, including a desktop, laptop, and our mobile app. After
            you enroll in a course, you can access it by clicking on the course
            link you will receive in your confirmation email (provided you’re
            logged into your Udemy account). You can also begin the course by
            logging in and navigating to your My learning page.
